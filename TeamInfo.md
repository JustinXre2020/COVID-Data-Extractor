## Project Summary

Our project focuses on delivering our users COVID-related health data. For instance, we may include the vaccination rate, hospitality rate, and the death rate of COVID-19 cases in the United States for the past two and a half years in our database. Our users can extract any of the data that they would like. 
In addition, we also plan to offer users the option to generate data visualizations based on the data that they choose to extract. It could be a scatter plot, a histogram and maybe even a map.
